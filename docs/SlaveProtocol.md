# Overview of protocol TWCs use to load share
#
# A TWC set to slave mode (rotary switch position F) sends a linkready message
# every 10 seconds.
# The message contains a unique 4-byte id that identifies that particular slave
# as the sender of the message.
#
# A TWC set to master mode sees a linkready message. In response, it sends a
# heartbeat message containing the slave's 4-byte id as the intended recipient
# of the message.
# The master's 4-byte id is included as the sender of the message.
#
# Slave sees a heartbeat message from master directed to its unique 4-byte id
# and responds with its own heartbeat message containing the master's 4-byte id
# as the intended recipient of the message.
# The slave's 4-byte id is included as the sender of the message.
#
# Master sends a heartbeat to a slave around once per second and expects a
# response heartbeat from the slave.
# Slaves do not send heartbeats without seeing one from a master first. If
# heartbeats stop coming from master, slave resumes sending linkready every 10
# seconds.
# If slaves stop replying to heartbeats from master, master stops sending
# heartbeats after about 26 seconds.
#
# Heartbeat messages contain a data block used to negotiate the amount of power
# available to each slave and to the master.
# The first byte is a status indicating things like is TWC plugged in, does it
# want power, is there an error, etc.
# Next two bytes indicate the amount of power requested or the amount allowed in
# 0.01 amp increments.
# Next two bytes indicate the amount of power being used to charge the car, also in
# 0.01 amp increments.
# Remaining bytes always contain a value of 0.
