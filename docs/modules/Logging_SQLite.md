# SQLite Logging Module

Development on this module is on pause.

The reason: It has added complexity for implementation above and beyond that which exists for CSV, yet it can only be used locally unlike MySQL. 

It is recommended to use CSV for local or MySQL for remote database in the meantime, until there's enough momentum for this module to be completed
