# TeslaMate Vehicle Integration

## Introduction

<a href="https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate">TeslaMate</a> is a self-hosted Tesla datalogger.

The purpose of this integration is to allow users of TWCManager who also use <a href="https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate">TeslaMate</a> to leverage on the work already performed by TeslaMate to fetch vehicle status, significantly reducing the number of Tesla API calls that TWCManager needs to make.

With both the API Token and Telemetry options enabled, we're effectively using TeslaMate to manage our API login credentials and fetch all of our vehicle status updates. The only requests that TWCManager would need to send are the initial API call to list all vehicles in your account, and commands (such as wake_up, charge, etc).

There is no requirement to use both sync functions when integrating with TeslaMate. You can sync only tokens, or only telemetry.

## Integrations

### Tesla API Tokens

TWCManager can synchronize the TeslaMate API tokens from the TeslaMate database. This allows token management to be performed on our behalf by TeslaMate rather than within TWCManager.

This is performed through direct queries of the TeslaMate database, and is not used by the telemetry feature of the TeslaMate module, which is separate. You do not need to use the API Token sync function even if you do use the telemtry sync function.

Please note that turning on the Token Sync functionality of this module will have the following affect on TWCManager's Tesla API token handling functionality:

   * You will no longer be prompted for your Tesla API login. Even if the TeslaMate tokens are invalid, you will not be prompted.
   * TWCManager will not refresh API tokens, however on refresh of the TeslaMate token, the token will be used by TWCManager.

#### Configuration

```
   "vehicle": {
       "TeslaMate": {
           "enabled": true,
           "syncTokens": true,
           "db_host": "192.168.1.1",
           "db_name": "teslamate",
           "db_pass": "teslamate",
           "db_user": "teslamate"
       }
   }
```

#### Access to Database Instance

By default, TWCManager may not be able to access the database for TeslaMate.

Depending on your TeslaMate installation type, you may need to take different steps to make the PostgreSQL database available to TWCManager in order to sync Tesla auth tokens. Follow the appropriate section below for your installation type.

##### Manual Installation

For a manual installation, the ```/etc/postgresql/pg_hba.conf``` file will need to be updated to allow the TWCManager host to connect remotely to the database.

Add the following line below to pg_hba.conf, substituting the IP address of your TWCManager machine:

```
host    teslamate       teslamate       192.168.1.1/32        md5
```

After adding this, reload the PostgreSQL configuration:

```
service postgresql reload
```

##### Docker Installation

To be updated - I am not using this configuration, I welcome feedback if you do.

### Telemetry Information

TWCManager can use the MQTT topics advertised by TeslaMate to recieve charge state and SoC information from your vehicle

#### Confirming Telemetry Flow

Once you have MQTT connectivity set up for TeslaMate telemetry, you should see the following log entry appear for each of the vehicles tracked by TeslaMate, as long as they are within your Tesla API credential account, which indicates that we have detected Telemetry information for this vehicle:

00:06:58 ðŸš— TeslaMat 20 Vehicle R*display_name* telemetry being provided by TeslaMate

This indicates that we have internally switched off telemetry polling to the Tesla API for this vehicle, to instead obtain the information from TeslaMate.

Note however that TeslaMate has a health indicator which indicates whether there is an issue with a TeslaMate vehicle's tracking or connectivity. If we see that the health indicator indicates an issue, we will stop tracking the telemetry via TeslaMate until it shows healthy again, and the following message will appear:

IN PROGRESS

It is possible for TeslaMate to lose connection to the MQTT server and for the data served to become stale. If this occurs, TWCManager will detect it within 1 hour of the data going stale if the vehicle was online at the time. Currently, if the vehicle was offline at the time it will not be detected. 

Once this is detected, TWCManager will print an error message similar to the below, and revert to API polling again:

```
18:03:25 ðŸš— TeslaAPI 40 Data from TeslaMateVehicle for *display_name* is stale. Switching back to TeslaAPI
```
