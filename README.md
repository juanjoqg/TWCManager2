## How it works

* In order to allow multiple Tesla Wall Connector (TWC) units to operate on a single power circuit, Tesla provides a Load-Sharing protocol to interconnect the Tesla Wall Connector units together, and to direct those units to charge at a specific rate based on the number of cars charging simtultaneously.
* This script (TWCManager) pretends to be a Tesla Wall Charger (TWC) set to master mode.
* When wired to the IN or OUT pins of real TWC units set to slave mode (rotary switch position F), TWCManager can limit car charging based on information from inverters and panels.
* This allows us to:
    * Track the real-time availability of green energy sources (including PV Inverters, Battery Systems and Weather APIs) and direct the slave TWCs to use near the exact amount of energy available for the current conditions.
    * Send on-demand commands to TWC devices to charge at specified rates and times.
    * Schedule charging to occur at regular intervals.
    * Control which vehicles can and cannot use a TWC device based on VIN (for supported vehicles and TWCs).

## Installation and Configuration

All installation and configuration documentation (Physical and Software) is contained in the documentation repository [here](docs/README.md)

## Interfaces

To enable TWCManager to gather the solar generation information that it requires to adjust the charging rate, we provide Interfaces to allow information to be retrieved (EMS Interfaces) and Interfaces to allow us to provide information to external systems to inform them of current charging output and number of cars currently charging.

### Communication Interfaces

### Logging Interfaces

Logging interfaces allow recording of statistics and values such as Green Energy data, Slave TWC status and Voltage and Amperage data to various interfaces.

This can be useful if you would like to track charger activity and use it for graphing or statistics purposes.

## Warnings

It is important to read and understand the following warnings before using this tool:

* Misuse of the protocol described in this software can direct a Tesla Wall Charger to supply more current to a car than the charger wiring was designed for.
* This will trip a circuit breaker or may start a fire in the unlikely event that the circuit breaker fails.
* This software was not written or designed with the benefit of information from Tesla and there is always a small possibility that some unforeseen aspect of its operation could damage a Tesla vehicle or a Tesla Wall Charger.
* All efforts have been made to avoid such damage and this software is in active use on the author's own vehicle and TWC.
* In short, USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Limitations
* Due to hardware limitations, TWCManager will not work with Tesla's older High Power Wall Connectors (HPWCs) that were discontinued around April 2016.
* We do not currently have enough information about the new 2020 Tesla Wall Connector devices with WiFi to understand if they will be compatible in any way (wired or wireless) with TWCManager.
