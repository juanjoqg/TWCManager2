        #
        # Byte 1 is a state code:
        #   00 Ready
        #      Car may or may not be plugged in.
        #      When car has reached its charge target, I've repeatedly seen it
        #      change from 03 to 00 the moment I wake the car using the phone app.
        #   01 Plugged in, charging
        #   02 Error
        #      This indicates an error such as not getting a heartbeat message
        #      from Master for too long.
        #   03 Plugged in, do not charge
        #      I've seen this state briefly when plug is first inserted, and
        #      I've seen this state remain indefinitely after pressing stop
        #      charge on car's screen or when the car reaches its target charge
        #      percentage. Unfortunately, this state does not reliably remain
        #      set, so I don't think it can be used to tell when a car is done
        #      charging. It may also remain indefinitely if TWCManager script is
        #      stopped for too long while car is charging even after TWCManager
        #      is restarted. In that case, car will not charge even when start
        #      charge on screen is pressed - only re-plugging in charge cable
        #      fixes it.
        #   04 Plugged in, ready to charge or charge scheduled
        #      I've seen this state even when car is set to charge at a future
        #      time via its UI. In that case, it won't accept power offered to
        #      it.
        #   05 Busy?
        #      I've only seen it hit this state for 1 second at a time and it
        #      can seemingly happen during any other state. Maybe it means wait,
        #      I'm busy? Communicating with car?
        #   08 Starting to charge?
        #      This state may remain for a few seconds while car ramps up from
        #      0A to 1.3A, then state usually changes to 01. Sometimes car skips
        #      08 and goes directly to 01.
        #      I saw 08 consistently each time I stopped fake master script with
        #      car scheduled to charge, plugged in, charge port blue. If the car
        #      is actually charging and you stop TWCManager, after 20-30 seconds
        #      the charge port turns solid red, steering wheel display says
        #      "charge cable fault", and main screen says "check charger power".
        #      When TWCManager is started, it sees this 08 status again. If we
        #      start TWCManager and send the slave a new max power value, 08
        #      becomes 00 and car starts charging again.
        #
        #   Protocol 2 adds a number of other states:
        #   06, 07, 09
        #      These are each sent as a response to Master sending the
        #      corresponding state. Ie if Master sends 06, slave responds with
        #      06. See notes in send_master_heartbeat for meaning.
        #   0A Amp adjustment period complete
        #      Master uses state 06 and 07 to raise or lower the slave by 2A
        #      temporarily.  When that temporary period is over, it changes
        #      state to 0A.
        #   0F was reported by another user but I've not seen it during testing
        #      and have no idea what it means.
        #
        # Byte 2-3 is the max current available as provided by bytes 2-3 in our
        # fake master status.
        # For example, if bytes 2-3 are 0F A0, combine them as 0x0fa0 hex which
        # is 4000 in base 10. Move the decimal point two places left and you get
        # 40.00Amps max.
        #
        # Byte 4-5 represents the power the car is actually drawing for
        # charging. When a car is told to charge at 19A you may see a value like
        # 07 28 which is 0x728 hex or 1832 in base 10. Move the decimal point
        # two places left and you see the charger is using 18.32A.
        # Some TWCs report 0A when a car is not charging while others may report
        # small values such as 0.25A. I suspect 0A is what should be reported
        # and any small value indicates a minor calibration error.
        #
        # Remaining bytes are always 00 00 from what I've seen and could be
        # reserved for future use or may be used in a situation I've not
        # observed.  Protocol 1 uses two zero bytes while protocol 2 uses four.

        ###############################
        # How was the above determined?
        #
        # An unplugged slave sends a status like this:
        #   00 00 00 00 19 00 00
        #
        # A real master always sends all 00 status data to a slave reporting the
        # above status. slaveHeartbeatData[0] is the main driver of how master
        # responds, but whether slaveHeartbeatData[1] and [2] have 00 or non-00
        # values also matters.
        #
        # I did a test with a protocol 1 TWC with fake slave sending
        # slaveHeartbeatData[0] values from 00 to ff along with
        # slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] of 00 and whatever
        # value Master last responded with. I found:
        #   Slave sends:     04 00 00 00 19 00 00
        #   Master responds: 05 12 c0 00 00 00 00
        #
        #   Slave sends:     04 12 c0 00 19 00 00
        #   Master responds: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
        #
        #   Slave sends:     08 00 00 00 19 00 00
        #   Master responds: 08 12 c0 00 00 00 00
        #
        #   Slave sends:     08 12 c0 00 19 00 00
        #   Master responds: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
        #
        # In other words, master always sends all 00 unless slave sends
        # slaveHeartbeatData[0] 04 or 08 with slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] both 00.
        #
        # I interpret all this to mean that when slave sends
        # slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] both 00, it's requesting a max power from
        # master. Master responds by telling the slave how much power it can
        # use. Once the slave is saying how much max power it's going to use
        # (slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] = 12 c0 = 32.00A), master indicates that's
        # fine by sending 00 00.
        #
        # However, if the master wants to set a lower limit on the slave, all it
        # has to do is send any heartbeatData[1-2] value greater than 00 00 at
        # any time and slave will respond by setting its
        # slaveHeartbeatData[1-2] to the same value.
        #
        # I thought slave might be able to negotiate a lower value if, say, the
        # car reported 40A was its max capability or if the slave itself could
        # only handle 80A, but the slave dutifully responds with the same value
        # master sends it even if that value is an insane 655.35A. I tested
        # these values on car which has a 40A limit when AC charging and
        # slave accepts them all:
        #   0f aa (40.10A)
        #   1f 40 (80.00A)
        #   1f 41 (80.01A)

        #     If you send 02 to a slave TWC with an error code that triggers
        #     the middle LED to blink red, slave responds with 02 in its
        #     heartbeat, then stops sending heartbeat and refuses further
        #     communication. Slave's error state can be cleared by holding red
        #     reset button on its left side for about 4 seconds.
        #     If you send an error code with bitmap 11110xxx (where x is any bit),
        #     the error can not be cleared with a 4-second reset.  Instead, you
        #     must power cycle the TWC or 'reboot' reset which means holding
        #     reset for about 6 seconds till all the LEDs turn green.
        #   05 Tell slave charger to limit power to number of amps in bytes 2-3.
        #
        # Protocol 2 adds a few more command codes:
        #   06 Increase charge current by 2 amps.  Slave changes its heartbeat
        #      state to 06 in response. After 44 seconds, slave state changes to
        #      0A but amp value doesn't change.  This state seems to be used to
        #      safely creep up the amp value of a slave when the Master has extra
        #      power to distribute.  If a slave is attached to a car that doesn't
        #      want that many amps, Master will see the car isn't accepting the
        #      amps and stop offering more.  It's possible the 0A state change
        #      is not time based but rather indicates something like the car is
        #      now using as many amps as it's going to use.
        #   07 Lower charge current by 2 amps. Slave changes its heartbeat state
        #      to 07 in response. After 10 seconds, slave raises its amp setting
        #      back up by 2A and changes state to 0A.
        #      I could be wrong, but when a real car doesn't want the higher amp
        #      value, I think the TWC doesn't raise by 2A after 10 seconds. Real
        #      Master TWCs seem to send 07 state to all children periodically as
        #      if to check if they're willing to accept lower amp values. If
        #      they do, Master assigns those amps to a different slave using the
        #      06 state.
        #   08 Master acknowledges that slave stopped charging (I think), but
        #      the next two bytes contain an amp value the slave could be using.
        #   09 Tell slave charger to limit power to number of amps in bytes 2-3.
        #      This command replaces the 05 command in Protocol 1. However, 05
        #      continues to be used, but only to set an amp value to be used
        #      before a car starts charging. If 05 is sent after a car is
        #      already charging, it is ignored.
        #
        # Byte 2-3 is the max current a slave TWC can charge at in command codes
        # 05, 08, and 09. In command code 02, byte 2 is a bitmap. With other
        # command codes, bytes 2-3 are ignored.
        # If bytes 2-3 are an amp value of 0F A0, combine them as 0x0fa0 hex
        # which is 4000 in base 10. Move the decimal point two places left and
        # you get 40.00Amps max.
        #
        # Byte 4: 01 when a Master TWC is physically plugged in to a car.
        # Otherwise 00.
        #

                    #
                    # Unfortunately, self.reportedAmpsActual < 4.0 can also mean

                    # where it decides it wants power the moment we decide it's
                    # safe to stop offering it. Thus, I think it's safest to
                    # always wait until the car has taken 5A for a minute before
                    # cutting power even if that means the car will charge for a
